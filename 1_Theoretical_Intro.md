## The Gauss Siedel  method
----------

<p> The Gauss Siedel method is an iterative method that can be used for linear systems of equations $$Ax = b$$ . It can be applied to any matrix with non-zero elements on it diagonals. However convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix is either diagonally dominant or symmetric and positive semi-definite. </p>
